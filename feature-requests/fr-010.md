# Feature Request

- REQUEST ID: FR-010
- DATE: 2026.01.06

## Abstract

This FR defines Collection page optimizations, focusing on collapsed-by-default grouping, improved Collection Item Details actions, and handheld-responsive table layouts.

## Scope

- Page: Collection
- Modal: Collection Item Details (album + pressings)
- Exclusions: backend API changes, data model changes

## UX Rules

### All Devices

- On entering the Collection page, all artist groups are collapsed.
- After delete, the currently open artist group remains open.
- Collection Item Details must include edit actions for:
  - Album (edit underlying Album record).
  - Pressing (edit underlying Pressing record per card).
- Any successful add/update/delete performed inside Collection Item Details must refresh:
  1) the modal data, then
  2) the Collection page data (cascade to parent).
- Album Details in the modal shows a “Last Update” field next to Discogs ID:
  - Line 1: browser-local date/time from album.updated_at
  - Line 2: current user name
- Pressing Details in the modal show:
  - Sleeve Type (from pressing packaging sleeve type)
  - Last Update (browser-local date/time from pressing.updated_at, line 2 user name)
  - Barcode/Identifiers in the same row as Sleeve Type and Last Update

### Add Pressing from Collection Item Details

- The “Items in Collection (x)” header includes an “Add Pressing” button.
- Clicking it opens a picker modal:
  - Existing pressings for the album are listed with pagination.
  - User can add any existing pressing to the collection.
  - User can create a new pressing using the same Pressing Wizard used on the Albums page.
- After a successful add:
  - The picker closes.
  - The Collection Item Details refreshes.
  - The Collection page refreshes.

### Handheld Table Layout (Collection page)

Apply only for handheld/touch devices.

- Width < 500px:
  - Show columns: Cover, Album, Genre, Actions (View only).
- Width 500px–999px:
  - Show columns: Cover, Album, Genre, Condition, Actions (View only).
- Width 1000px–1139px:
  - Show full desktop list.
  - Actions arranged in a 2x2 grid:
    - Row 1: View | Edit
    - Row 2: [blank] | Delete

## AI Instructions

- Limit changes to `frontend/src/pages/Collection.tsx`, `frontend/src/pages/Collection.css`, and `frontend/src/components/Modals/CollectionItemDetailsModal.tsx` unless required.
- Preserve existing dark theme and table styling.
- Keep changes additive and avoid altering API contracts.
- Ensure add/update/delete actions in the modal notify parent handlers for refresh.

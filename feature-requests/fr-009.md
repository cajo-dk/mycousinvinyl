# Feature Request

- REQUEST ID: FR-009
- DATE: 2026.01.06

## Abstract

This FR defines the redesigned Statistics page layout across desktop and handheld devices, focusing on scannable summaries and a simplified action area.

## Scope

- Page: Statistics (Home)
- Components: statistics cards, latest additions cards
- Exclusions: navigation changes, data model changes

## UX Rules

### All Devices

- Remove the Quick Actions section entirely.
- Preserve existing data and labels unless explicitly changed below.
- Keep the visual language consistent with the dark theme.

### Laptops and Workstations

- Maintain the current desktop layout and card arrangement.
- No changes to the existing grid structure or card contents beyond the handheld-specific rules.

### Handheld Devices: Portrait

- Use a single-column, full-width vertical stack in this order:
  1. Albums in Collection
  2. Purchase Summary
  3. Collection Value
  4. Latest Addition
  5. The One Before
- Purchase Summary layout:
  - Left column: Average Purchase, Most Expensive Purchase
  - Right column: Total Purchase Value (highlighted number)
- Collection Value layout:
  - Left column: Low Est. Sales Price, High Est. Sales Price
  - Right column: Avg. Est. Sales Price (highlighted number)

### Handheld Devices: Landscape

- Use a two-column vertical stack:
  - Row 1 (columns 1+2 merged): Albums in Collection
  - Row 2: Purchase Summary (left), Collection Value (right)
  - Row 3: Latest Addition (left), The One Before (right)
- Purchase Summary and Collection Value layouts match portrait rules.

### Latest Addition Cards (Both Handheld Orientations)

- Image on the left.
- Right of image: Artist, Album, Purchase Price.
- Below image (full-width row): Min / Avg / Max estimated sales price on a single line.

## AI Instructions

- Modify only `frontend/src/pages/Home.tsx` and `frontend/src/pages/Home.css` unless a change is explicitly required elsewhere.
- Do not reintroduce the Quick Actions section.
- Keep desktop layouts intact; apply changes only via handheld portrait/landscape rules.
- Use CSS media queries and class-based overrides rather than duplicating components.
- Ensure the card order matches the specified stacks for portrait and landscape.

# Feature Request

- REQUEST ID: FR-007
- DATE: 2026.01.03

## Abstract

Add an album scanning tool, the user can consult when shopping for vinyl records. The tool should allow the user to take a photo of the album with their mobile device, have the Album Wizard AI exttract the artist name and album name - and then tell them if they or any of the users in their collection-sharing list (from Profile) owns a pressing of the album.

## Information

### Album Wizard AI

The Album Wizard AI is an agent built with the OpenAI Agent Builder. It takes an album cover image as input_text and returns a JSON object like this example:

{
"artist": "The Beatles",
"album": "The White Album",
"image": true,
"artist_confidence": 0.97,
"album_confidence": 0.95,
"combined_confidence": 0.92,
"popular_album": "White Album"
}

To check if anybody in the user's collection-sharing group owns a pressing of the album in the image, the following process shold be implemented:

1. Lookup the "artist" property from the wizard response in the MyCousinVinyl's artist database. Partial matches are valid if no exact match is found
2. If a match is returned, skip to step 4
3. If no match is found, return a "no artist match" result
4. Search the list of albums with a foreign key pointing to the found artist in MyCousinVinyl's album database. First search on the "album" property and, if there is a match, use that album - otherwise search on the "popular_album" property and use that album. Partial matches are valid if no exact match is found
5. If a match was found in step 4, skip to step 7
6. If no album match was found, return a "no album match" result
7. Check if any user in the owners grid has a pressing of the found album in their collection_items list and, for matched users, return their icon information

## User Stories

### Story #1

As a user, on a mobile device with the screen in portrait mode, I want to see the top bar menu as a drop down hamburger menu instead if the standard top menu bar.

### Story #2

As a user, i want to be able to select "Album Wizard" from the hamburger menu.

### Story #3

As a user, when on the Album Wizard page, I want to use my device's camera to take aa picture of the album cover and tell me, the album exists in the system, and if I or other users in my collection-sharing list own a pressing of the album.

### Story 4

As a system, I want to allow the user to take a picture with the camera in their mobile device and then either accept the picture or try again.

### Story 5

As a system, I want to send the image to the Album Wizard AI and receive the result.

### Story 6

As a system, I want to use the owners-grid information to show ownership for people in the grid. If a user owns a pressing, their icon should be shown, otherwise it should be hidden.

## UX

The Album Wizard, when shown in portrait mode should have a look like the following (col1-3 are collectors' icons):

```
+--------------------+
| Hamburger Menu     |
+--------------------+
|                    |
|       Camera       |
|                    |
+--------------------+
| Found Artist: xxxx |
| Found Album: yyyy  |
+--------------------+
|       Owners       |
|                    |
|  +------+------+   |
|  | col1 | col2 |   |
|  +------+------+   |
|  | col3 | col4 |   |
|  +------+------+   |
|                    |
+--------------------+
```

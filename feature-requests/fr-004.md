## User Stories

### Story #1

As a user, when creating an artist, i want to have a button next to the artist name. When clicked, it should trigger a search in Discogs for the artist. If the service returns more than 1 artist, the 3 top results should be shown. I should be able to click the desired entry and have the fields Active to/from, Country and Biography populated. I must type at least 3 characters in the field before the button becomes active.

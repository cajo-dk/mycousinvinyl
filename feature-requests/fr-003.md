## Abstract

The purpose of this FR is to make it possible to upload and show a cover image tied to a specific pressing.

## User Stories

### Story #1

As a user, when creating or editing a pressing, I want to be able to attach a album cover image for that particular pressing.

### Story #2

As a user, when viewing a list of pressings, I want to see a thumbnail of the cover for each pressing.

### Story #3

As a user, when viewing "My Collection", I want to see a thumbnail of the cover for that particular pressing. If the pressing doesn't have a cover image, I want to see a thumbnail of the album's cover image instead.

### Story #4

As a user, I want the "My Collection" view to be categorized by artist similar to the "Albums" view

# Feature Request

- REQUEST ID: FR-008
- DATE: 2026.01.05

## Abstract

This FR aims at streamlining the menu system on both mobile devices and laptops/workstations.

## UX Rules

### All Devices

- For each device type, the menu must be uniform for all pages.

### Handheld Devices

Handheld Devices covers cellphones and tablets that can operate in portrait or landscape mode. Some rules apply to both orientations while others apply to a specific mode. When building the menu, first the shared rules must be considered, followed by the mode-specific rules.

#### Mode: Portrait or Landscape

- The top menu bar height cannot exceed 80px

- The MyCousinVinyl logo-text should be left-justified and clickable

- The menu should be a right-justified hamburger menu with the options (each option must include icon + text):

  - My Collection
  - Artists
  - Albums
  - Pressings
  - Album Wizard
  - "Other >"
    - Profile
    - Settings
    - Sign Out

#### Mode: Portrait

- Search field and filter functionality must be initially hidden

- An icon button (mdiMagnify) should be placed to the immediate left of the hamburger menu button and, when clicked, display a scrollable search and filter modal.

#### Mode: Landscape

- Search and filter functions should be centered and visible

- The "Other >" submenu must expand left and up to remain within the viewport.

### Laptops and Workstation Devices

- The top menu bar height cannot exceed 80px

- The MyCousinVinyl logo-text should be left-justified and clickable

- The menu should be a row of icon-buttons left justified and to the immediate right of the MyCousinVinyl logo-text:

  - My Collection
  - Artists
  - Albums
  - Pressings
  - Album Wizard

- Other icon-buttons should be right-justified (listed from left to right):

  - Profile
  - Settings
  - Sign Out

- Search and filter functions should be centered between the two blocks of menu-items

## AI Instructions

- Update only the navigation-related UI files under `frontend/src/components/Layout/` unless a change is explicitly required elsewhere.
- Preserve the existing dark theme, icon set (mdi), and modal-first interaction patterns.
- Implement handheld behavior for both portrait and landscape orientations: hamburger menu on the right, with icon + text for each menu item.
- Portrait: hide search/filter by default and use a magnify icon button to open a scrollable search + filter modal.
- Landscape: keep search/filter centered and visible; ensure the "Other >" submenu opens left and up to stay on-screen.
- Desktop: left-aligned primary icon buttons next to the logo, centered search/filter, and right-aligned profile/settings/sign-out.
- Keep the header height at or below 80px and ensure the menu is uniform across all pages.

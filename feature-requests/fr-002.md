# Feature Request

- REQUEST ID: FR-002
- DATTE: 2025.12.22

## Abstract

The purpose of this FR is to make it possible for a user to see, when other logged in users update the system

## User Stories

### Story #1

As a system, I want to publish a status message to a ActiveMQ subject whenever a user performs a CRUD operation in either Collections, Artists, Albums, or Pressings.

The event should contain:

- The user's name
- The type of operation
- The major details of the object being affected
- The time and date

### Story #2

As a user, I want to have a status bar at the bottom of my screen, listening on a web socket where messages pop up for 20 seconds whenever another user performs a CRUD operation on an object. After 20 seconds the message should fade away. New messages immediately preempt any message currently being shown.

Example Messages:

dd-mm-yyyy hh:mm:ss - User coyote@acme.com added artist Mel Torme to the system
dd-mm-yyyy hh:mm:ss - User coyote@acme.com added album The Velvet Fog to their collection
